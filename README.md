## Introduction
Many web applications require users to verify their mobile numbers before using the application. Rather than forcing you to re-implement this on each application, this package provides convenient methods for sending and verifying mobile verification requests.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```shell
composer require fouladgar/laravel-mobile-verification
```
> Laravel 5.5 uses Package Auto-Discovery, so you are not required to add ServiceProvider manually.

### Laravel <= 5.4.x

If you don't use Auto-Discovery, add the ServiceProvider to the providers array in ``config/app.php`` file

```php
'providers' => [
  /*
   * Package Service Providers...
   */
  Fouladgar\MobileVerification\ServiceProvider::class,
],
```


## Configuration

To get started, you should publish the `config/mobile_verification.php` config file with:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Fouladgar\MobileVerification\ServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

If youâ€™re using another table name for `users` table or different column name for `mobile` or even `mobile_verification_tokens` table, you can customize their values in config file:

```php
// config/mobile_verification.php

<?php

return [

    'user_table'    => 'users',
    
    'mobile_column' => 'mobile',
    
    'token_table'   => 'mobile_verification_tokens',

    //...
];
```

And then migrate the database:
```
php artisan migrate
``` 

The package migration will create a table your application needs to store verification tokens. Also, a `mobile_verified_at` column will be add to your `users` table to show user verification state.

### Model Preparation

In the following, verify that your `User` model implements the `Fouladgar\MobileVerification\Contracts\MustVerifyMobile` contract and use the `Fouladgar\MobileVerification\Concerns\MustVerifyMobile` trait:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Fouladgar\MobileVerification\Contracts\MustVerifyMobile as IMustVerifyMobile;
use Fouladgar\MobileVerification\Concerns\MustVerifyMobile;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements IMustVerifyMobile
{
    use Notifiable, MustVerifyMobile;

    // ...
}
```

### SMS Client

You can use any SMS service for sending verification messages such as `Nexmo`, `Twilio` or etc. For sending notifications via this package, first you need to implement the `Fouladgar\MobileVerification\Contracts\SMSClient` contract. This contract requires you to implement `sendMessage` method. 

This method will return your SMS service API result via a `Payload` object which contains user **number** and **token** message:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Fouladgar\MobileVerification\Contracts\SMSClient;
use Fouladgar\MobileVerification\Notifications\Messages\Payload;

class SampleSMSClient implements SMSClient
{
    /**
     * @param Payload $payload
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function sendMessage(Payload $payload)
    {
        // return $this->NexmoService->send($payload->getTo(), $payload->getToken());
    }

    // ...
}
```
> :information_source: In above example, `NexmoService` can be replaced with your chosen SMS service along with its respective method.

Next, you should set the your `SMSClient` class in config file:

```php
// config/mobile_verification.php

<?php

return [

  'sms_client' => App\SampleSMSClient::class, 
    
  //...
];
```

## Usage

Now you are ready for sending a verification message! You just need to dispatch the `Illuminate\Auth\Events\Registered` event after registering user:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Auth\Events\Registered;

// Register user

 event(new Registered($user));

//...
```

At this point, a notification message has been sent to user and you've done half of the job! 


## Routing

This package includes the `Fouladgar\MobileVerification\Http\Controllers\MobileVerificationController` class that contains the necessary logic to send verification token and verify users.

### Verify

In order to use this route, you should send `token` message of an authenticated user (along with any desired data) to this route `/auth/mobile/verify`:

```
curl -X POST \
      http://example.com/auth/mobile/verify \
      -H 'Accept: application/json' \
      -H 'Authorization: JWT_TOKEN' \
      -F token=12345
```

### Resend

If you need to resend a verification message, you can use this route `/auth/mobile/resend` for an authenticated user:

```
curl -X POST \
      http://example.com/auth/mobile/resend \
      -H 'Accept: application/json' \
      -H 'Authorization: JWT_TOKEN'
```

### Customize Routes and Controller

In order to change default routes prefix or routes themselves, you can customize them in config file:

```php
// config/mobile_verification.php

<?php

return [

    'routes_prefix' => 'auth',

    'routes' => [
        'verify' => '/mobile/verify',
        'resend' => '/mobile/resend',
    ],

    //...
];
```

Also this package allows you to override default controller. To achieve this, you can extend your controller from `Fouladgar\MobileVerification\Http\Controllers\BaseVerificationController` and set your controller namespace in config file:

```php
// config/mobile_verification.php

<?php

return [

    'controller_namespace' => 'App\Http\Controllers',

    //...
];
```
> **Note:** You can only change controller namespace and name of the controller should remain as package default controller (`MobileVerificationController`)

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Fouladgar\MobileVerification\Http\Controllers\BaseVerificationController;

class MobileVerificationController extends BaseVerificationController
{
    /**
     * Where to redirect users after verification.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $redirectTo = '/home';
}

```

> **Important note**: If you set header request to `Accept:application/json`, the response will be in Json format, otherwise the user will automatically be redirected to `/home`. You can customize the post verification redirect location by defining a `redirectTo` method or property on the `MobileVerificationController`.

## Protecting Routes

Route middleware can be used to only allow verified users to access a given route. This package ships with a verified middleware, which is defined at `Fouladgar\MobileVerification\Http\Middleware`. Since this middleware is already registered in your application's HTTP kernel, all you need to do is attach the middleware to a route definition:

```php
Route::get('profile', function () {
    // Only verified users may enter...
})->middleware('mobile.verified');
```

## Translates and Views

To publish translation file you may use this command:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Fouladgar\MobileVerification\ServiceProvider" --tag="lang"
```

If you are not using AJAX requests, you should have some views which we provided you some information through session variables. In case of errors, you just need to use laravel default `$errors` variable. In case of successful verification, you can use `mobileVerificationVerified` variable and for successful resend verification you may use `mobileVerificationResend` variable. These variables contain messages which you can customize in provided language file:

```php
// lang/vendor/MobileVerification/en/mobile_verification.php

<?php

return [
    'successful_verification' => 'Your mobile has been verified successfully.',
    'successful_resend'       => 'Your token has been resent successfully.',
    'already_verified'        => 'Your mobile already has been verified.',
];
```

## Event

This package dispatch an event during the mobile verification process. You may attach listeners to this event in your `EventServiceProvider`:

```php
/**
 * The event listener mappings for the application.
 *
 * @var array
 */
protected $listen = [
    'Fouladgar\MobileVerification\Events\Verified' => [
        'App\Listeners\LogVerifiedUser',
    ],
];
```

## Testing
```sh
composer test
```
